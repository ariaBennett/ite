// Current plan is to include all stub functionality
// in the shared server/client methods, seperated by
// isClient isServer etc; 
// Would be easier to see when there are multiple 
// executions of similar code and how they can best
// simulate each other.  If it turns out that stubs
// need a more exclusive section, this could be used 
// for that in the future.
